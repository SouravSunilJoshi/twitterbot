# twitterbot

I created a fully automated Twitter bot that uses the Twitter API to schedule and post tweets on a server, eliminating the need for manual intervention. The bot is highly functional and ideal for businesses or individuals seeking to maintain an effective social media presence with minimal time and effort.
